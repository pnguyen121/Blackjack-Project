Getting Started:

Game Rules:
- Reaching 21 is the goal. 
- If you go past 21 with your cards you lose.
- The dealer will automatically hit if their card totals is less than 17.
- If player and dealer get the same total it is a draw.
- If player cards are greater than dealer, player wins.
- If dealer cards are greater than dealer wins
- Deck is shuffled after every round.

Game Mechanics:
- Start the game by hitting the bet button which deals cards from a randomly shuffled deck and adds up the totals
- Make a decision of hitting or standing by hitting the buttons that appear after you bet
- Finish the round
- Hit play again to keep on playing!
- Scores will be saved on the scoreboard.

Good Luck!


Next steps:
- adding a betting component with dollar values.
- animate the cards to flow out of the deck rather than just appear
